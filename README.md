# Project: Web Scraping on Flipkart Website

In this project, I have done web scraping on Flipkart website using Python. I have used BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to scrape the data. I have extracted the product name, price, rating, and reviews of the product. I have also stored the data in a CSV file.

## Libraries Used:
- BeautifulSoup
- requests
- pandas

## Files included:
- flipkart_web_scraping.ipynb
    This file contains the code for web scraping on Flipkart website.
- laptop_data.csv
    This file contains the data extracted from the Flipkart website.
- cleaning_data.ipynb
    This file contains the code for cleaning the data.
- cleaned_data.csv
    This file contains the cleaned data.



## Steps:
1. Send an HTTP request to the URL of the webpage you want to access.
2. Parse the HTML content of the page to extract the data.
3. Store the data in a CSV file.
4. Clean the data by doing some preprocessing.
5. Save the cleaned data in a CSV file.


## Installation:
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.
```bash
pip install requests
pip install BeautifulSoup4
pip install pandas
```
